        for our craps game on the html side, we need:
        1. button to play craps
        2. Crap status line
        3. Header saying craps played here

    Craps would be played, to help draw awareness to the Space program.
    As a way to demonstrate that there are more things to do other then work all the time.
    It also helps to keep the minds of the astronauts sharp for their duties.
    Also to show that they can also have a little bit of fun on the side of their daily duties.
